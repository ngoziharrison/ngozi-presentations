## About Me
2nd year PhD Student in Department of Information Studies, UCLA
from Oakland, CA
**Previously** Creative Effectiveness Lead @ Google
**Areas of Interest**: Critical AI Studies, Race and Digital Justice, Knowledge Organization, Critical Data Studies, Machine Learning Fairness/Responsibility/Ethics
**Research Topic**  My research focuses on examining the mathematical, conceptual, and logical foundations of information systems and computation. I seek to explore non-western logics and modes of computation to develop liberatory frameworks for information science.

My research is focused on the social aspects of mathematical knowledge, particularly the mathematics and computational methods behind AI, algorithms, and sociotechnical systems.

I am interested in the theory and application of machine learning techiques and especially related to issues of race, bias, fairness, and justice

I am interested in the philosophy, ethics, and justice

My interests stretch across critical scholarship on technology, mathematics, and computational methods

My research is at the intersection of machine learning, mathematics, and critical information studies. I am interested in critically examining the philosophical, ethical, and social implications of machine learning systems and developing new approaches to mathematics, computation, and machine learning informed by equity and justice

Currently, my research is focused on addressing issues of equity and fairness surrounding the machine learning technique of non-negative matrix factorization and other similar techniques for text mining and dimensionality reduction with documents.

The goal of my research is to bridge the gap between critical humanities/social science research on AI/ML and mathematical approaches to fairness and equity, and justice. 

My research is focused on the use of mathematical methods and machine learning to build inclusive, equitable, and liberatory technologies. I am also interested in critically analyzing the 

I am interested in information system, mathematics, and machine learning techniques. My is focused on the use of mathematical methods and machine learning in order to build inclusive, equitable, and liberatory technologies. I am also interested in the philosophy, ethics, and social implications of machine learning/AI systems and ways of mitigating potential harms and exposing dangerous hype

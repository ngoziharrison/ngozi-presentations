# Citations and Use of Evidence
	- Unclear how citation connects or supports argument
	- Citation formatted incorrectly
	- Quotation presented without context or connection back to key point or claim

---
# Works Cited/References Page
	- Works cited page should not have bullets or numbers
	- Entries should be alphabetized by the first item in the citation, usually the authors last name
	- Works Cited and references should be on a separate page, not the same page as your conclusion
	- Check example papers formatted using your citation style and compare with your paper. You can find these on the Purdue OWL website
	- Missing citations

# What did we learn about AI?


---
# Review of Key Terms

---
# Artificial Intelligence
	- **Artificial Intelligence** refers to a broad field and collection computational and mathematical techniques to make computers perform tasks that we typically associate with human intelligence
	- Machine Learning is a subfield of AI
	- First coined in 1950

---
# Large Language Model
	- A **Large Language model** is a type of Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that is trained on massive data sets of text and uses deep neural networks in order to predict or generate text
	- GPT is a kind of LLM and stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer

---
# Deep Learning
	Deep learning is another name for deep or multilayerd neural networks


---
# Types of AI Models (nonexhaustive)
	- Generative 
		- LLMs
		- Diffusion Models
		- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
	- Discriminitive

There are three paradigmatic ways of introducing linear algebra which we can classify as elementary, computational, and abstract. 

# Three ways of defining Linear Algebra
|  Classification  |  Definition  |
|----|----|
|  Elementary  |  Linear Algebra is the study of vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, and problems that can be solved using linear algebraic techniques  |
| Abstract   | Axler defines Linear Algebra as "the study of the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional spaces" (Axler, 2015)  |
|  Computational  |  "Linear Algebra is the study of vectors and ways of manipulating vectors" (Deisenroth, 2020) |

# There are three core concepts in linear algebra
	Scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ 
	We can think of a scalar as a single value, usually a real number
	Vector 
	Example Vector $a = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\3 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ Vectors are objects that we add together and multiply by a scalar to get another vector. 

	Matrix A $m\times n$ matrix is a collection of elements consisting of $m$ rows and $n$ columns. We  can think of matrices as a collection of vectors or a linear transformation
	Example Matrix 
	$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 8 & 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$

# History of Linear Algebra
	Linear algebra encompasses many techniques that evolved over time and in several places including China, Europe, Greece, and Egypt

	In the 19th century James Joseph Sylvester and Arthur Cayley introduced algebraic techniques for linear algebra and coined the term matrix, which comes from the Latin term for womb 

---
# What does Linear mean?
	Linear transformations are functions that map one vector to another

	Formal Definition
	A transformation $L()$ is called linear if the following properties hold
	Addition: $L(v+w) = L(v) + L(w)$
	Scalar Multiplication: $L(\lambda v) = \lambda \cdot L(v)$

# What is Algebra?
	Algebra comes from the name the text Al-jabr (الجبر) written by polymath Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi who worked in Baghdad in the 9th century
	Algebra broadly refers to the formal manipulation of abstract symbols

# Linear Algebra in Machine Learning
	Linear algebra allows for optimization, efficient computation, data representation and manipulation
	Data is represented using vectors and matrices
	Dot product, matrix manipulation, and matrix transformations are important to machine learning
	Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and matrix decompositions are important for fundamental ML algorithms (PCA, SVD, Regression, NMF, Neural Networks)
	Vector embeddings are a core way ML systems represent data as points in n-dimensional space, this is why the abstractness of linear algebra is important

### Critically analyzing the role of Mathematics in Machine Learning
	“Part of the challenge of understanding algorithmic oppression is to understand that mathematical formulations to drive automated decisions are made by human beings. While we often think of terms such as “big data” and “algorithms” as being benign, neutral, or objective, they are anything but.” (Noble, 2018, p. 19)

### Critically analyzing the role of Mathematics in Machine Learning cont'd
	“The math-powered applications powering the data economy were based on choices made by fallible human beings. Some of these choices were no doubt made with the best intentions. Nevertheless, many of these models encoded human prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into the software systems that increasingly managed our lives. Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists. Their verdicts, even when wrong or harmful, were beyond dispute or appeal. And they tended to punish the poor and the oppressed in our society, while making the rich richer.” (O'Neil, 2016, p. 12)

Mathematics, data, and computation endow machine learning with an opacity and epistemic authority. Opacity because these systems are difficult to understand without technical expertise. Unassaillable epistemic authority because we think of mathematics and computers as unbiased. However, norms, biases, values, and assumptions can be baked into the way we build and use technical systems. Mathematics is an important fundamental layer to how we build machine learning sytems

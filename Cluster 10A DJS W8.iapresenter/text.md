# Some things to key in mind regarding Gen AI
	- Keep in mind the tendancy for hallucination, banality, and sycophancy with Gen AI.
	- You can use AI for research and informating seeking but it isn't necessarily the best tool. Make sure you verify the information that you get using Gen AI
	- We want to hear your creative thoughts, reflections and arguments. The goal of this class is that you challenge/refine your thinking and grow in your writing ability
	- If you have used Gen AI you must disclose and describe how you used it in your assignment. If you used Gen AI our past two assignments you can add a comment to your submission disclosing the use and how it was used.
	- Be careful using AI in data analysis, make sure you understand what AI is doing or the code that is being generated

# Keywords
Data, Justice, and Society

# Keywords as a Genre
- Not a <mark>definition</mark>
- Critically think about origin, meaning, uses
- Reveal the complexity of a word or term
- Instability and fluidity of language

# Data
“...the term “data” indicates any form of information—itself a loaded term—that is intended to be put to use.” (Klein and Posner, 2020, p. 83)

---
# What Makes Something Data?
- computationally tractable
- Information put to use
- Purports to represent something
- Can be but not limited to numbers
- Used in argument
<!--Add statements from klein and posner on what is data-->



---
# **Discussion** What Isn't Data?


---
It seems like what we consider to be data has a lot to do with our perspective

What informs our perspective on whether or not we can consider something data?

---
# Computational Tractability
Data is not always necessarily digital, but as Klein and Posner argue, data is something that is computationally tractable, meaning that it can be manipulated, classified, ordered, etc. using computational/mathematical techniques


--- 
# How Do We Define Information

There are many different definitions of information:
- Information as evidence
- Information as signal
- Information as message
- Information as thing 
- Information as semantic content

(Furner, 2010)

---
# Data and Information
Both data and information are terms we use everyday to describe content. The specific meaning and criteria of information and data can depend on context, purpose, and in many cases discipline. 

Part of the power of data and information is the fluidity of the concepts

---
Data tends to emphasize the "for purpose" nature of content while information emphasizes the transmissability

---
# Data as Evidence
Evidence is a particular kind of information that is used to support an argument or chain of reasoning.

---
## What Does Data Have to Do with Justice?

In King's letter, Data is used as evidence to support his argument about justice, and ground his actions in theological truth, moral certitude, and justified action

---

# Society In Raymond Williams

Society $\not =$ State
**Discussion** What's the difference?

---
# Annotating Jennifer L. Morgan’s “Producing Numbers”

---
# Activity Discussing our Annotations
- Break up into pairs and discuss your annotations and annotation process
## Discussion Questions
- Was there anything that you both annotated in the reading?
-  Was there anything that someone else annotated that you didn't notice
- What is one question from your group that you would like to share?
- How does this article connect to data
- What book or further reading would you like to check out

# Slave Voyages Activity (20min)

Imagine you are a researcher or data analyst working on a project and need data from the Slavevoyages data set. Pair with another student and develop a **research question** for your project. Next explain **how you would answer this question** using the dataset.

Write  a discussion post of listing the names of the group members and roles, the research question, and a potential way to answer the question

# What is Biopower?

> “One may speak of bio-power to designate what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculation and made knowledge·power an agent of transformation of human life.” (Foucault, 1990) 

*As quoted in (Hacking, 2015, p. 279)*




---

> “Enumeration demands kinds of things or people to count. Counting is hungry for categories. Many of the categories we now use to describe people are byproducts of the needs of enumeration.” (Hacking, 2015, p. 280)



here Hacking illustrates how the avalanche of numbers and the enumeration of people brought about a new kind of power for the state to use. 


---
# The US Census and Computation
![bg left](images/Pasted%20image%2020241021112140.png)

Hacking argues that enumeration is hungry for categories, in addition enumeration is also hungry for computation

Herman Hollerith submitted this patent in 1889 for punchcard machine to calculate and record statistical information for the 1890 census. He later went on to form IBM.

Collection, storage,  analysis and prediction based on data has driven the need for more computation power

---

# How Data Happened

As a concept data emerges from the development of the modern concept of **science**, methods and innovations in **mathematics**, and **theological** arguments. From it's history in these particular disciplines, data inherits a claim to objectivity and truth


---
# Where Did Statistics Come From?


 'Statistik' was coined by Gottfried Achenwall in 1749 and he thought of what he called *statistics* as the collection of 'remarkable facts about the state'.

Statistics evolved out of the study and quantification of the state. Large scale efforts to take census, measure populations, and track state relevant metrics.


<!--printing press, publishing of statistics, sometimes was a private enterprise sometimes was state sponsored, statistics is one way of reading numbers-->
(Hacking, 1990)

### What is an Average

Mathematically we can represent an average as: 
$$
\overline x =  \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}x_{i}
$$

but an average can also be a knowledge claim based on data

With the quote we read in class, Quetelet lays down the philosophical grounding for what an average is and what claims we can make about that data. Statistically we can define a common or average as a typical specimen

---
# A Priori Vs a Posteriori

**a priori**
Knowledge prior to experience

**a posteriori**
knowledge comes after experience, i.e. empirical evidence or data


---

### Modes of Reasoning and Knowledge Production
 
**Deductive reasoning**
deductive reasoning means moving from premises to conclusions by drawing valid inferences. A valid inference means that it logically follows from the premises

**Inductive reasoning**
Inductive reasoning is where generalizations or principles are made from a body of observations

**Abductive reasoning**
Formalized by C.S. Pierce in the 19 th century, abductive reasoning seeks a plausible conclusion from a set of observations

---
# What Do We Do with Data and Statistics?

Statistics when combined with Data can be used for it's **descriptive** or **predictive** purposes


---

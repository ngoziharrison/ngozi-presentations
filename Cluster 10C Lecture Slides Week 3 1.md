Often in seminar classes, the majority of your note-taking happens before class while you read. During class, you develop new ideas and build connections. Then, your notes and the new ideas you've developed come together in your writing assignments and reflections.

# What Are Expert Systems?
Expert systems is an approach within the field of AI that seeks to build computer systems that could perform as a human expert would. 


---
# Building Expert Systems
As Forsythe describes, building an expert system involves three steps:

1. Collecting information from one or more human informants and/or from documentary sources; 
2. Ordering that information into procedures (such as rules and constraints) relevant to the operations that the prospective system is intended to perform
3. Designing or adapting a computer program to apply these rules and constraints in performing the designated operations. (Forsythe, 1993, p. 451)

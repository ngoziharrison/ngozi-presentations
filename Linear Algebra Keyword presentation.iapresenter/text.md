There are three paradigmatic ways of introducing linear algebra which we can classify as elementary, computational, and abstract. 

# Three ways of defining Linear Algebra
|  Classification  |  Definition  |
|----|----|
|  Elementary  |  Linear Algebra is the study of vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, and problems that can be solved using linear algebraic techniques  |
| Abstract   | Axler defines Linear Algebra as "the study of the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional spaces" (Axler, 2015)  |
|  Computational  |  "Linear Algebra is the study of vectors and ways of manipulating vectors" (Deisenroth, 2020) |
Linear 

An elementary introduction to linear algebra focuses on vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, and the number of problems and applications that can be solved using linear algebraic techniques

Advanced (abstract) linear algebra is "the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional spaces". In this way, linear algebra becomes a way of abstractly representing notions of space and transformations that can easily be adapted across many contexts.

	There are three core concepts in linear algebra
	Scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ 
	We can think of a scalar as a single value, usually a real number
	Vector 
	Example Vector $a = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\3 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ Vectors are objects that we add together and multiply by a scalar to get another vector. 

	Matrix A $m\times n$ matrix is a collection of elements consisting of $m$ rows and $n$ columns. We  can think of matrices as a collection of vectors or a linear transformation
	Example Matrix 
	$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 8 & 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$

# History of Linear Algebra
	Linear algebra encompasses many techniques that evolved over time and in several places including China, Europe, Greece, and Egypt

	In the 19th century James Joseph Sylvester and Arthur Cayley introduced algebraic techniques for linear algebra and coined the term matrix, which comes from the Latin term for womb

# What does Linear mean?
	Linear transformations are functions that map one vector to another

	Formal Definition
	A transformation $L()$ is called linear if the following properties hold
	Addition: $L(v+w) = L(v) + L(w)$
	Scalar Multiplication: $L(\lambda v) = \lambda \cdot L(v)$

# What is Algebra?
	Algebra comes from the name the text Al-jabr (الجبر) written by polymath Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi who worked in Baghdad in the 9th century

	Algebra broadly refers to the formal manipulation of abstract symbols

# How Linear Algebra is used in Machine Learning
	Machine learning models represent data as vectors and use many Linear Algebra to represent and transform complex collections of data. In this way vectors are used to abstractly represent data as points in space

### Common uses of Linear Algebra
	- Data Representation
	- Word Embeddings, i.e using vectors to represent words for NLP
	- Calculating Similarity between data points

One of the key ideas within linear algebra is the term matrix which was coined by Sylvester and comes from the latin word mater for womb




Linear algebra allows for the abstract representation of data

significance of linear, algebra to data machine learning in AI to a critical perspective building upon the quote that we discussed often that data and act which represents linear algebra often provides the mode of representation of data thus when acting as the motive representation what is linear, algebra enacting and what does it allow us to do 

One of the fundamental ideas of layer algebra is a notion of space. We can take two data points and consider where they are specially located and relation to one another. This is easy if we’re talking about the Cartesian plane and we have two points with XY coordinates however how do we consider two movies and where these two movies are located in relation to each other this is one of the things that linear algebra allows us to do is create abstract notion of space and develop ways to situate data points in relation to each other

Somewhere in the mathematics machine learning book, they provide a dual notion of vectors and so I wanna bring that back in. I think it’s in the later part of the first chapter.

# History of Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is an area of mathematics that focuses on the representation of 

is core to machine learning and the representation of data in a computationally tractable way. Specifically, Machine learning models represent data and computations as matrices and vectors for efficient computation and to 

Linear algebra tends to be introduced in both in an elementary way and advanced (abstract) sense

An elementary introduction to linear algebra focuses on vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, and the number of problems and applications that can be solved using linear algebraic techniques

Advanced (abstract) linear algebra is "the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional spaces". In this way, linear algebra becomes a way of abstractly representing notions of space and transformations that can easily be adapted across many contexts.

Linear algebra does not have one origin point but encompasses many techniques that evolved over time and in several places.

significance of linear, algebra to data machine learning in AI to a critical perspective building upon the quote that we discussed often that data and act which represents linear algebra often provides the mode of representation of data thus when acting as the motive representation what is linear, algebra enacting and what does it allow us to do 

One of the fundamental ideas of layer algebra is a notion of space. We can take two data points and consider where they are specially located and relation to one another. This is easy if we’re talking about the Cartesian plane and we have two points with XY coordinates however how do we consider two movies and where these two movies are located in relation to each other this is one of the things that linear algebra allows us to do is create abstract notion of space and develop ways to situate data points in relation to each other

Somewhere in the mathematics machine learning book, they provide a dual notion of vectors and so I wanna bring that back in. I think it’s in the later part of the first chapter.

One of the key ideas within linear algebra is the term matrix which was coined by Sylvester and comes from the latin word mater for womb

There are three core concepts in linear algebra
scalars, vectors, and matrices

Linear algebra allows for the abstract representation of data

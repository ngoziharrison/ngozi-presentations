# From Foucault and Hacking to Du Bois
	- From Foucault and Hacking we learn about the role that statistics, quantification, and numeracy plays in the operation of biopower as a means of controlling bodies and populations
	- Du Bois seeks to use the tools of data, social science, and data visualization in order to display a view from below and document the lives and material conditions of African Americans living in early 1900s America


---
# W.E.B. Du Bois 
	- Father of American Sociology
	- Sociologist, Philosopher, Pan African organizer, Civil Rights Activist, Science fiction writer

# What is Society?

---
	> “Society is now clear in two main senses: as our most general term for the body of institutions and relationships within which a relatively large group of people live; and as our most abstract term for the condition in which such institutions and relationships are formed.” (Williams, 2014, p. 228)

---
# Using Data to study the Social
	When we use data to study the *social* we seek to measure aspects of society to make empirical claims.

# Why Should we Study Society? What are some of the issues that can come up in the study of society?


---

	> “Two considerations thereafter broke in upon my work and eventually disrupted it: first, one could not be a calm, cool, and detached scientist while Negroes were lynched, murdered, and starved; and secondly, there was no such definite demand for scientific work of the sort that I was doing. I regarded it as axiomatic that the world wanted to learn the truth and if the truth was sought with even approximate accuracy and painstaking devotion, the world would gladly support the effort.” 
	– W.E.B. Du Bois, Dusk of Dawn, pp. 67-8.

# DuBois, Data Portraits, and Ways of Seeing
	- Data analysis and visulization is fundamentally an interpretive act
	- DuBois and his team show the power of visualization by combining the abstraction and visual elemnts with 
	- Visualization brings together the storytelling, aesthetics, and the politics of representation 

---
### Through abstraction, visualization flattens and simplifies to highlight an aspect of reality to convey some information about sociological phenomenon


	> "The rendering of information in a visual format to help communicate data while also generating new patterns and knowledge through the act of visualization itself." 
	– Whitney Battle-Baptiste and Britt Rusert

---
# Analysis and Visualization
	- Descriptive vs ==Analytical==
	- Discuss how the visual and aesthetic choices impact the presentation
	- Keep in mind the limitations and your assumptions

# Activity Breaking Down Complex Sentences (30min)
	Activity Discussing our Annotations
	- Break up into pairs and discuss your annotations and annotation process
	- Identify one passage or sentence that you both highlighted
	- Post a response to the discussion post containing the following
		- Define any words that are confusing 
		- Paraphrase this passage in your own words
		- What do you still have questions about in the passage? Is there anything that seems unclear, complex, or confusing?

# Data Portraits Workshop


---
# Data portraits assignment
	1. Identify a theme/topic for which you will collect data through observation. 
	2. Consider how you will record the data: Are you counting something? Are you recording sounds? Are you talking to people? 
	3. How will you delimit, structure, and analyze your data? Are you plotting trends over time or particular events in space? Where does your data collection begin and end?  What are its temporal and spatial bounds?
	4. How can you visualize your data and what do you think it “says”? Can you use your data to advance an argument or make a claim about something? 
	5. What rhetorical and aesthetic choices will you make to visualize your data? (how will you draw from Du Bois?)

---
# What we will work on today
	- Develop and articulate a strong topic and research question for your project
	- Describe your methods
	- Decide on a mode of visualization for your data and start your visualization
	- Conduct and describe your analysis

---
# Which part of the assignment do you feel the least confident about
	- research question

# **Discussion** Let's generate some research questions



--- 
# **Activity** Develop your research question (15 min)
	Pair up and take some time to write up your research question
	Share your research question and provide feedback
	- Why are you interested in this? Why does this matter?
	- Is the research question clear?
	- What are the limitations?
	
	We'll will go around the room and share back

# Writing Tips

---
# General Feedback from Last Year
	- When reading back your work and editing, make sure the reader can clearly identify your key point or argument
	- When using quotations and citations it's important to provide a close reading and/or tie back to the main argument
	- When possible, be specific
		- watch out for ambiguity that can confuse the reader
	- Use sentence transitions and signposts to guide the reader
	- Think about what you want your reader's key takeaway to be

---
# Learn yourself as a writer
	- Learn yourself as a writer
		- What writers do you like, try to mimic their style, study the craft
		- Identify frequent mistakes you make and when editing read for this
		- Start thinking about your voice

# My frequent mistakes
	- Overuse of *however*, makes the writing feel repetitive
	- getting lost in tangents and forgetting the main point
	- Long complicated sentences with too many clauses skipping words when I write sentences

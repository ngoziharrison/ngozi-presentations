# Why focus on labor when discussing technology?


---


	Often, when we talk about technology, we focus on the consumer side; however, this can cause us to miss the more opaque and mundane ways in which technology operates


---


- Workers lives are increasingly controlled by algorithms that are used by corporations to maximize efficiency


	Focusing on labor when discussing technology reveals the hidden ways that technology and those in power control society and use technology for domination. We can also find ways of resisting or using technology for justice, liberation, and designing a better world

# Background Sources
	These sources provide information that sets up an argument. Background sources provide important context, set up stakes, or provide the logical grounding for your claims

---

# Exhibit Sources
Exhibit sources provide evidence and material for analysis or interpretation


---
# Argument Sources
Argument sources provide claims that you as the writer will engage with in some way. You may agree and use them to support your argument or diverge from or challenge these claims


---
# Theory/Method Sources
Theory sources provide concepts, theoretical frameworks, or vocabulary that will inform your approach
Method sources provide the method that you will use in your analysis or build on


---
# Often a source can be used in any of these four ways

---
# Activity Part 1 (10min)
	Choose one source you have collected in your zotero folder and reply to the discussion post with an answer the following questions
	- Who is the author? What are their creditials?
	- What is the purpose of this source?
	- What is the scope of the source
	- Who published the source
	- How current is the source


---
# Activity Part 2 (10min)
	Next break into pairs and discuss your source with your partner
	- Explain your research idea or topic
	- Discuss how you found this source
	- Discuss how this source might help you with your research paper



---

# Research Working Time (30min)
	Use this time to update your research journal, conduct research on your topic, and ask questions

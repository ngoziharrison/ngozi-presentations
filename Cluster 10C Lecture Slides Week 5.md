# Writing Activity Week 5
In this activity you will reflect on what we learned last week during our keyword presentations and your own experience developing your keyword presentation

Question 1: Choose a Keyword presented by one of your classmates. What did you learn? What surprised you? How did this keyword connect to other presentations? What recurring themes did you notice during day? How has this impacted your understanding of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence?

Question 2: Reflect on your own process developing your keyword presentation. How did you approach making your presentation? Did you incorporate the research from your annotated bibliography? Did you have to add additional research? What did you find challenging about the assignment? What did you enjoy while working on the assignment? What questions do you still have about your chosen keyword?

Please write at least one paragraph per question reflecting on one of your peer's keywords and your experience developing your presentation. You do not have to answer all of the questions, the purpose is thoughtful engagement.

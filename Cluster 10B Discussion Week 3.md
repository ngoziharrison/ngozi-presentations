# A Guide to Academic Reading

- Reading is a dynamic not static activity
- Read strategically not necessarily linearly, learn to identify the key points of the argument
- If you don't get it, keep going instead of getting stuck
- Take notes while you read
- Think of questions while you read, have a conversation with the text or artifact
- Put texts in conversation with one another
- Consider the audience, discipline, and genre
- The abstract is a roadmap to the paper or article, if you are confused or get lost, return to the abstract

---

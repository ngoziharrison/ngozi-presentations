# My Example
	*I am studying* machine learning fairness
	*because I want to find out* how ML fairness researchers are defining fairness and developing measurements and assessments of fairness
	*in order to help my reader understand* what values, norms, abstractions, and assumptions are embedded in machine learning fairness interventions and how these might limit effectiveness

### Activity
# Developing your research question
	Respond to the discussion post by filling in the blanks on the three step formula


---
### Lecture and Discussion (15min)
# Blade Runner


---
# Tech Utopia vs Tech Dystopia

	**Utopia**
	Techno-Utopia emphasizes how technology will transform the world and lead to a greater life for humanity
	Singularity is an example of a techno-utopian vision for humanity

	**Dystopia**
	Dystopia emphasized the harms and destruction of the world by technology, often as a result of humanity losing control of technology
	Blade Runner's LA is an example of a techno-dystopia

# BLADE RUNNER
	Based on 1968 Philip K. Dick novel *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*
	Released in 1982

# Discussion Question
	What does it mean that Blade Runner is set in our past?


---

	> All I can say is that the world in BLADE RUNNER is where I really live. That is where I think I am anyway. This world will now be a world that every member of the audience will inhabit. It will not be my private world. It is now a world where anyone who will go into the theatre and sit down and watch that film will be caught up and the world is so overpowering that it is going to be very hard for people to come out of it and adjust back to what we normally encounter
	– Philip K. Dick quoted in The Official Collector’s Edition Blade Runner Souvenir Magazine

# Blade Runner's Techno-Dystopia

	- Fear of China an Japan Techno-Orientalism
	- Environmental Degredation and Post Nuclear collapse

	- Housing Shortage
	- Humanoid Androids

# Sociotechnical Imaginary
	Sociotechnical imaginary is a term developed by Jasanoff and Kim to refer to collectively held imagined forms of social life and social order attainable through technological means


---
	“Taking these complexities into account, we redefine sociotechnical imaginaries as ==“collectively held, institutionally stabilized, and publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science and technology.”== This definition privileges the word “desirable” because efforts to build new sociotechnical futures are typically grounded in positive visions of social progress. It goes without saying that imaginations of desirable and desired futures correlate, tacitly or explicitly, with the obverse—shared fears of harms that might be incurred through invention and innovation, or of course the failure to innovate. The interplay between positive and negative imaginings—between utopia and dystopia—is a connecting theme throughout this volume.” (Jasanoff and Kim, 2015, p. 6)
---

### Discussion Question
	What kinds of futures can we imagine?
	What kinds of futures should we imagine?


---
# What are other visions of Techno-Utopia or Techno-Dystopia

---
### Research Topic
# Comparing and Integrating Sources


---
# Foregrounding the Missing Data
	How are you incorporating missing data into your paper?


---
# What to work on between now and next week
	Part A) What specific data already exists about your issue
	Part B) What data should but does not exist (Missing data)


---

# Research Working Time (30min)
	Use this time to update your research journal, conduct research on your topic, and ask questions

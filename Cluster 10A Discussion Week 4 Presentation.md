> “One may speak of bio-power to designate what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculation and made knowledge·power an agent of transformation of human life.” (Foucault, 1990) 

*As quoted in (Hacking, 2015, p. 279)*

> “Enumeration demands kinds of things or people to count. Counting is hungry for categories. Many of the categories we now use to describe people are byproducts of the needs of enumeration.” (Hacking, 2015, p. 280)



here Hacking illustrates how the avalanche of numbers and the enumeration of people brought about a new kind of power for the state to use.

# The US Census and Computation

Hacking argues that enumeration is hungry for categories, in addition enumeration is also hungry for computation

Herman Hollerith submitted this patent in 1889 for punchcard machine to calculate and record statistical information for the 1890 census. He later went on to form IBM.

Collection, storage,  analysis and prediction based on data has driven the need for more computation power

# **Activity** Genealogy of Classification, Categorization, and Measure

---
# Genealogy of Classification, Categorization, and Measure
Split into pairs, choose a term, and find answers to the following questions 
- Origin of the name?
- why did the US choose this system? (Focus on the history and politics)
- Who developed this system?
- When was it developed?
- What is your source for this information (If wikipedia, what is wikipedia's source)

# **Activity** Analyzing Census Data 
- Open the data.census.gov page and look up your home address
- What data ==does== the census contain about your zip code? 
- What kinds of questions can you answer with this data

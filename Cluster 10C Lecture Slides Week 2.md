# A Guide to Academic Reading
- Reading is a dynamic not static activity
- Read strategically not necessarily linearly, and learn to identify the key points of the argument
- If you don't get it, keep going instead of getting stuck
- Take notes while you read
- Think of questions while you read, have a conversation with the text or artifact
- Put texts in conversation with one another
- Consider the audience, discipline, and genre
- The abstract is a roadmap to the paper or article, if you are confused or get lost, return to the abstract

Often in seminar classes, the majority of your note-taking happens before class while you read. During class, you develop new ideas and build connections. Then, your notes and the new ideas you've developed come together in your writing assignments and reflections.

---
# **Activity** Reading Together (group)
Break into groups of 2
come up with:
- 3 big ideas from the reading
- 2 connections to other readings
- 1 discussion question
- Post to discussion board

After 15 min we will share back with the class

# The term Artificial Intelligence was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy and a team of collaborators
Today we will focus on the history before this moment

# Prehistory of Computational Reason

Prehistory of computational reason describes the many theories, methods, and experiments at creating mechanical and symbolic technologies for automating human reasoning capabilities

---
Within the many attempts at automating reasoning, there are several recurring concepts
- Abstraction
- Formalization
- Classification
- Data
- Algorithms
- Learning

# Meet the Author Rodrigo Ochigame
- Assistant professor in the Institute of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University.
- Research examines unorthodox models of computational rationality, such as nonclassical logics from Brazil, nonbinary Turing machines from India, and frameworks of information science from Cuba.
- Ochigame received a BA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

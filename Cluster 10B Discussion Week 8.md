# Feedback on Search Essay
- Good
    - A lot of growth in terms of good thesis statements. Strong, descriptive, with good context and focused
    - A lot of improvement in writing ability, voice, and confidence in your ideas
- Room for growth
    - Introducing quotes and citations, using sources. Want to see deeper engagement with sources and readings. Also when introducing quotes need to make sure you tie it back to the argument and clearly show the reader how this connects to the main point you are trying to make. 
    - Practice common introductory phrases for quotes and sources, and look at our readings for examples of introducing citations
    - passive vs active voice
    - When you cite digital keywords since it is a collected volume you cite the name of the person who wrote the specific article in this case Gillespie instead of Peters who is the editor
    - watch out for long unwieldy long sentences
    - Try not to wait till the end of your essay to bring in your key source

# Some things to Clarify
- Google $\not =$ Internet
- ChatGPT is not a database
- AI does not just mean generative AI i.e. chatgpt, for example there is also Machine Learning and AI behind Google search
- Google search is complicated and contains many components and the results you see are informed by many different systems, data points, etc. Google has a lot of information about you and your past searches which inform both the search results and the ads you see

# Missing Data Thesis Workshop and Working Time
The goal of this workshop is for you to walk away with a solid idea for your first draft and a thesis statement to build on
**Phase 1** Pitch and Feedback
Pair up with the student next to you and pitch your topic ideas to each other for 3 min. While one peer is talking the other should be listening and jotting down notes and questions. After the first person pitches we will switch and then each group will have 10min to discuss
**Phase 2:** Workshop Thesis Statement
Choose one of the models in the handouts posted and take 15min to work on your thesis statement and notes for the missing data assignment
**Phase 3:** Identify Sources
Listen back to your partner's draft thesis statement and give them three potential sources they can use to support their thesis and analysis.

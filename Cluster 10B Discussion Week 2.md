# Tech Utopia vs Tech Dystopia


<span class = "columns">
Utopia

Techno-Utopia emphasizes how technology will transform the world and lead to a greater life for humanity
Singularity is an example of a techno-utopian vision for humanity

**Dystopia**
Dystopia emphasized the harms and destruction of the world by technology, often as a result of humanity losing control of technology
Blade Runner's LA is an example of a techno-dystopia

# What makes data BIG?


---

## “Big Data is less about data that is big than it is about a capacity to search, aggregate, and cross-reference large data sets.”

-boyd and Crawford, 663.

# What are some of the myths and beliefs you've heard about Big Data?

---

# If all data is cooked then we can consider a tenet of data justice Bowker's challenge that "Data should be cooked with care"

(Bowker 2005, pp. 183 – 184)



---
# Beliefs Inform Practices

It is important for us to examine the values and beliefs that inform the people who hold power and develop technologies,  technology is not a values free enterprise.


---


# TESCREAL IDEOLOGIES

Gebru and Torres argue we should resituate our understanding of various technologies emerging ideologies within the long  history of eugenic thought. They also seeks to break up the binary of the doomer/accelerationist paradigm around AGI.

**T**ranshumanism **E**xtropianism **S**ingularitarianism **C**osmism **R**ationalism **E**ffective **A**ltruism **L**ongtermism

## Stanford University and the History of Eugenics

This is David Starr Jordan, first president of Stanford University and Eugenicist


---
# Eugenics and California

In the early 20th century California was an important center for eugenicist thought. In addition to Stanford University, **The Human Betterment Foundation** was founded in 1928. Psychologist Lewis Terman was a member and created the **IQ test** in 1916.

# Two kinds of Eugenics

### Positive Eugenics 
Refers to the goal of increasing positive/desirable traits and the overall quality of the human stock. Examples include fitness competitions, telling white people to have more babies, encouraging high IQ people to reproduce
### Negative Eugenics
Refers to attempting to reduce less desirable traits in humans. Outlawing miscegenation, limiting immigration, sterilization


---
# Ideology, Technology, and Politics

Technology often appears to be apoltical and objective, however, last quarter we learned how data specifically and technology broadly is always political and related to operations of power. Gebru and Torres challenge us to engage with online ideological movements and subcultures and consider how they inform tech as an industry, narratives around technology, and technologies effect on society



---
# Rationalism
An ideology that emerged from the LessWrong website, founded by Eliezer Yudkowsky in 2009. Rationalists focus on “improving human reasoning and decision making,” and many members believe that advanced AI is “a very big deal for the future of humanity”
(Gebru and Torres)

---
# Effective Altruism
A movement that could be seen as the twin sibling of Rationalism. Whereas Rationalists aim to maximize their rationality, Effective Altruists strive to maximize their “positive impact” on the world
(Gebru and Torres)



---
# Accelerationism

Accelerationism is the idea that we must accelerate society, technology, or conflict in order to bring about social change. Many different varieties of accelerationism both left wing, right wing, and variants that don't cleanly fit in the left right binary. Many accelerationists build their arguments on their readings of Baudrillard and Deleuze and Guattari.

---
# Accelerationism and AGI
In this context we are mostly talking about the accelerationism movement, ideology, and political philosophy developed by Philosopher Nick Land. Nick Land was previously affiliated with the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit of whom Mark Fisher was also a member. A key source for Nick Land's accelerationist thought is his 2017 essay "A Quick-and-Dirty Introduction to Accelerationism". Nick Land has gradually become more right wing and esoteric, coined the term the dark enlightenment. Other thinkers have taken up his ideas and applied them to AI and argue we need to accelerate the race for AGI to bring about the singularity.


---
 # e/acc

e/acc stands for effective accelerationism is the combination of effective altruism (an outgrowth of utilitarianism that emerged from Stanford) and accelerationism. Idea that we must pursue technological progress at all costs.

---
# Discussion Questions
- Have you encountered any of these movements on the internet or IRL?
- How do you think we should approach understanding technology and data specifically?


---
# Big Data and the End of the Scientific Method

#### At the petabyte scale, information is not a matter of simple three- and four-dimensional taxonomy and order but of dimensionally agnostic statistics. It calls for an entirely different approach, one that requires us to lose the tether of data as something that can be visualized in its totality. It forces us to view data mathematically first and establish a context for it later.
– Chris Anderson

# BLADE RUNNER

Based on 1968 Philip K. Dick novel *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*
Released in 1982
Set in 2019

---

> All I can say is that the world in BLADE RUNNER is where I really live. That is where I think I am anyway. This world will now be a world that every member of the audience will inhabit. It will not be my private world. It is now a world where anyone who will go into the theatre and sit down and watch that film will be caught up and the world is so overpowering that it is going to be very hard for people to come out of it and adjust back to what we normally encounter
– Philip K. Dick quoted in The Official Collector’s Edition Blade Runner Souvenir Magazine

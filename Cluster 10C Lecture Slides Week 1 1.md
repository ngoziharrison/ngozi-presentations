Algorithmic Culture seeks to describe how culture and technology are fundamentally intertwined. It is important to acknowledge how algorithms shape our world while also acknowledging how algorithms themselves are artifacts of our culture and social relations.

# Knuth Definition of Algorithm
Computer scientist Donald Knuth defines algorithms using five basic properties: **finiteness**, **definiteness**, **inputs**, **outputs**, and **effectiveness** (Knuth, 1997)

---
“In Keywords, Raymond Williams highlights how important terms change over time. But for many of the “digital keywords” here, just as important is the simultaneous use of a term by different communities, particularly inside and outside of technical professions, who seem often to share common words but speak different languages.” (Gillespie, 2016, p. 18)

---
“In the case of algorithm, the **technical specialists**, the social scientists, and the broader public are using the word in different ways. For **software engineers**, algorithms are often quite simple things; for the broader public they are seen as something unattainably complex. For **social scientists**, algorithm lures us away from the technical meaning, offering an inscrutable artifact that nevertheless has some elusive and explanatory power (Barocas, Hood, and Ziewitz 2013, 3). We find ourselves more ready to proclaim the impact of algorithms than to say what they are. This is not to say that critique requires a settled, singular meaning, or that technical meanings necessarily trump others. But we should be cognizant of the multiple meanings of algorithm as well as the discursive work the term performs.” (Gillespie, 2016, p. 18)

---
A lesson here is that as we investigate algorithms and begin to transition into investigating Artificial Intelligence it is important to pay attention to the **meanings**, **norms**, and **values** associated with these terms across disciplines

# Technical $\to$ Sociotechnical 
The goal of this class is to move from a purely technical understanding of AI systems to a sociatechnical perspective that considers the historical, social, and cultural contexts and power relations that inform these technologies

# Why do we read?

# A Guide to Academic Reading

- Reading is a dynamic not static activity
- Read strategically not necessarily linearly, learn to identify the key points of the argument
- If you don't get it, keep going instead of getting stuck
- Take notes while you read
- Think of questions while you read, have a conversation with the text or artifact
- Put texts in conversation with one another
- Consider the audience, discipline, and genre
- The abstract is a roadmap to the paper or article, if you are confused or get lost, return to the abstract

---
# **Activity** Reading Together (individual)

- Download article by Matt Bui and Safiya Noble and load into Zotero
- read the abstract (15min)

---
# **Activity** Reading Together (group)
Break into groups of 4
come up with:
- 3 big ideas from the reading
- 2 connections to other readings
- 1 discussion question
- Post to discussion board

After 15 min we will share back with the class

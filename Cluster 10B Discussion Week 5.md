 # Data Politics Essay Feedback

---
# Highlights
- Very interesting topics and creative essays
- Good job tying your chose technology or case study to data and some of our recent discussions
- Good job working under the word limit

---
# General Feedback
- When reading back your work and editing, make sure the reader can clearly identify your key point or argument
- When using quotations and citations it's important to provide a close reading and/or tie back to the main argument
- When referencing readings and sources, make sure you don't misunderstand the text or accidentally misrepresent the argument
- When possible, be specific, watch out for ambiguity that can confuse the reader
- Individual responsibility and agency is important, but I also want you to think about the structural aspect and effects of technology
- Don't just take the claims of companies at face value, apply the critical lens we've used in class to think through some of the claims and ask why the companies are making them. Who benefits?

# Conducting your data analysis

Need to look at the data and interpret to make arguments but also analyze the dataset itself as an object that has a history and politics

# Questions to consider when analyzing data sets
- Describe the dataset?
- Where did this data come from? 
- Who collected the data and why? What was the method?
- What does this data purport to represent?
- What conclusions can be drawn from the data? What are the limitations? 
- What are the unaddressed assumptions or gaps?

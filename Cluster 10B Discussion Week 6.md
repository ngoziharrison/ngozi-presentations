# “Part of the challenge of understanding algorithmic oppression is to understand that mathematical formulations to drive automated decisions are made by human beings. While we often think of terms such as “big data” and “algorithms” as being benign, neutral, or objective, they are anything but.” (Noble, p. 19)

The gaze is the other that sees you. The gaze is what we use to describe the awareness of being perceived by the other. This is an important concept in critical theory, philosophy, sociology, and psychoanalysis. More specific examples of the gaze include the male gaze, the white gaze, the colonists' gaze, etc.

## On Format
	Today's talk is an experiment exploring the interplay of *form* and *improvisation*

### Concepts
	Logic
	Recursion
	Abstraction
	Matrix
	Critical Technical Practice

---
### Form
	Concept
	Motivation
	Example
	Provocation

Motivation is something that I picked up from the way mathematics is taught. When new concepts, definitions or theorems are taught they are provided with motivation which tells you why you should care and situates it in relation to other topics

	>“Part of the challenge of understanding algorithmic oppression is to understand that the mathematical formulations which drive automated decisions are made by human beings.” (Noble, 2018, p. 1)

Mathematics is a social practice and emerges from culture. mathematics is a cultural product and exists in a dialectical relationship with culture. Daily practices, language, ideology, aesthetics, and material constraints affect and are affected by mathematical knowledge. Mathematics is deeply embedded in a social and historic context which is worthy of investigation

### My Research Interests 
$\text{blackness} + \text{mathematics} + \text{information}$


---

	Black Computational Thought is a concept developed by Romi Ron Morrison
	> “Black Computational Thought takes critical aim at the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought as it maps onto and subtends contemporary computational logics.” (Morrison, 2022)


---
### Computation
	Computation can be defined as any well defined process for calculation. Computation takes a series of inputs and within a finite amount of steps produces an output

#### Computation is a... 
	- method
	- metaphor
	- organizing frame for understanding reality

---
##### Provocation
	> Why does anti-blackness seem to perpetually overdetermine and saturate the operating system regardless of who is programming it?” (Morrison, 2022)

---

### To that provocation I answer
	We must investigate the foundational concepts of logic, mathematics, information, and capital in order to illuminate the enlightenment and colonial epistemologies that undergird modern technology. 

---
### In this work, my point of departure is centering mathematics as a site of inquiry and intervention


---
	In thinking about Black Computational Thought I am thinking alongside the work of Safiya Noble, Timnit Gebru, Ramon Amaro, Sylvia Wynter, Eduoard Glissant, Fred Moten, Kattherine McKittrick, Huey P. Newton, Charles W. Mills, Oscar Gandy Jr., Denise Ferreira da Silva, Calvin Warren, Andre Brock, Frantz Fanon, Simone Browne, Ruha Benjamin, Ron Eglash, ...

# Social Logic
	Social logic refers to the "logics" of social systems. The principles that seem to guide the behavior and dynamics of social systems and organize social relations

---
### Logic of Opacity as a Social Logic
	>"Obfuscation and secrecy work together to form an operating logic of opacity around social media moderation. It is a logic that has left users typically giving little thought to the mechanisms that may or may not be in place to govern what appears, and what is removed, on a social media site." (Roberts, 2018)

In a paper called  Digital detritus: 'Error' and the logic of opacity in social media content moderation Roberts talks about the operating logic of opacity that guides social media platforms and content moderation



---

###	Formal logic $\leftrightarrow$ Social Logic

In theorizing formal logic and social logic it's important for us to think about the relationship between the two formal logics cocretize and enact social logics and social logics are both enacted by and restricted by the affordances of formal logics

---
	##### Provocation
### How might we design logics which expand beyond the bounds of western reason and rationality?
---
## Recursion




---
### Recursion is an iterative feedback loop where a process or procedure invokes itself
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144$

When I first learned about recursion in school it was through the classic fibonnacci algorithm and it was taught as what Gillepsie calls algorithm as trick or a trick of the trade. This is a tool that you can pull out of your toolbox to accomplish specific tasks. 
Godel's recursive functions is an equivalent model of computation to turings machine
The spiral as analogy both for the mode of dialectical thought but also recursion

---
### Recursion and African Fractals
	>What is special about the underlying concept of recursion are the ways in which a kind of mathematical.  feedback loop can generate new structures in space and new dynamics in time. (Eglash, 1999, pg 108)

In examining African fractal geometries and iconography, Eglash identifies recursive knowledge systems and construction techniques

### Recursion challenges our typical conception of linearity and temporality within computational processes

Not just a recovery but looking to pasts, alternatives, and contigent futures that are both transformative and repairative
“In closing, I want to be clear: Black Computational Thought is not just a historic  
recovery of the fact that Black people have done some shit with numbers. It is an  
epistemic confrontation with the logics of computation situated elsewhere and  
challenges the very nature of what we consider computation to be and to have been. It  
is an argument for forms of computing embedded in technologies of living,[28] connected to care work, to fullness,  
to difference, and to shared practices of risky meaning making.” ([Morrison, 2022)

##### Provocation
### How does recursion affect our understanding of the relationship between temporality and computation?




---
## Abstraction


---

###### Artistic, mathematical, and computational practice relies on some degree of abstraction
/assets/Clipboard 2.png
size: contain


---
### Abstraction as process
	Process for developing models of phenomenon which emphasizes properties, structure, and relationships 

### Abstraction as object
	The outcome of the process of abstraction, a concept which acts as a stand-in for all specific instances that exhibit general principals and properties

Abstractions allow us to choose aspects to emphasize and find patterns
---
### Three Key Aspects of Abstraction
	Joy of Abstraction $\to$ **Libidinal**
	Beauty of Abstraction $\to$ **Aesthetic**
	Social Practice of Abstraction $\to$ **Political**


---
### Abstractions are useful but have limits
	There are limits to abstraction particularly in situations where situatedness and embodied knowledge are important

---
###### Provocation
### How can we design modes of computation that engage with both abstract and embodied, situated knowledge?

The film the matrix depicts a all encompasing dystopia which everyday it feels like we are getting closer to. For example I don't know if you all saw Mark Zuckerbergs recent inteview but he says that essentially Facebook wants to provide more people with AI friends to help with the loneliness epidemic

Next to the film we have the critical work by patricia hill collins where she introduces the matrix of domination. Matrix thinking provides a paradigm for us to understand the many dimensions of of how one might experience domination or oppression. Particularly focues on Black women 


talk about the calvin warren talk about Blackness and Mathematics and his idea of straddling

	**Definition** Matrix
	A matrix $A$ is a $m \cdot n$ tuple of elements $a_{ij}, i=1\dots n, j=1\dots n$ 
	$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 8 & 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$
	Matrices can be used to represent a collection of vectors or a linear transformation

In the 19th century James Joseph Sylvester and Arthur Cayley introduced algebraic techniques for linear algebra and coined the term matrix, which comes from the Latin term for womb 

today we call these determinants minors which  are generated by removing one or more of it's rows and columns

	 In 1850, English mathematician John Joseph Sylvester coined the term matrix from the latin *mater* meaning mother or womb

Sylvester describes a matrix as a rectagular array that gives birth to several things he calls determinants which we now call a special case of determinants called minors

Now I'm not a expert on latin or etymology but I think there is something interesting about the conflation of mother and womb and the use of this word mater to describe something that performs a kind of productive labor even in a conceptual sense.

There are three paradigmatic ways of introducing linear algebra which we can classify as elementary, computational, and abstract. 

### Three ways of defining Linear Algebra
|  Classification  |  Definition  |
|----|----|
|  Elementary  |  Linear Algebra is the study of vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, and problems that can be solved using linear algebraic techniques  |
| Abstract   | Axler defines Linear Algebra as "the study of the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional spaces" (Axler, 2015)  |
|  Computational  |  "Linear Algebra is the study of vectors and ways of manipulating vectors" (Deisenroth, 2020) |


---
### Common Applications of Linear Algebra
#### Data Representation
	Data is represented using vectors, matrices, and tensors
#### Dimensionality Reduction
	Transformation of data from a high-dimensional space to a low dimensional space.
#### Recommender Systems
	Recommender systems use a process called matrix factorization or decomposition to learn user preferences for certain features of items

---
### Linear Algebra is about space

## Critical Technical Practice


---
### Critical Tecnical Practice is a term developed by Phil Agre to describe a way of approaching technological work

---
	> A critical technical practice will, at least for the foreseeable future, require a split identity -- one foot planted in the craft work of design and the other foot planted in the reflexive work of critique. 
	
---
	> Successfully spanning these borderlands, bridging the disparate sites of practice that computer work brings uncomfortably together, will require a historical understanding of the institutions and methods of the field, and it will draw on this understanding as a resource in choosing problems, evaluating solutions, diagnosing difficulties, and motivating alternative proposals. (Agre, 1998)
	


---
### Reflexivity
	Calls for data justice, quantitative justice, computational justice argue for the use of formal methods to pursue justice

	While doing this work, we must also examine the foundations of our methods, hidden epistemologies, and resist reducing social issues to purely technical problems
---
##### Provocation
### What does care look like as a critical technical practice?

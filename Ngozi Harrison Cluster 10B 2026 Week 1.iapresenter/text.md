### Technical Artifacts have histories and politics
	- Understand how histories and politics of racialized, gendered exclusion can be embedded in datasets, algorithms, and AI to erase and silence critical constituencies

---
### How do we mobilize data for Justice
	- Learn about the use data to mobilize for racial, gender, economic, and social justice

---
### Setting the Stage for Datafication
	Datafication is how we make the transition from understanding data in a historical context to our contemporary context


---

	“We need to open a discourse – where there is no effective discourse now about the varying temporalities, spatialities and materialities that we might represent in our databases, with a view to designing for maximum flexibility and allowing as possible for an emergent polyphony and polychrony. Raw data is both an oxymoron and a bad idea; to the contrary, data should be cooked with care. (Bowker 2005, pp. 183 – 184)”

---

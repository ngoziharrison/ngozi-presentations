# Discussion Questions Alternative Paths for AI
- In your opinion what should a path to developing AI technologies look like?
- What values and philosophies should guide the development of Machine Learning, NLP, and various AI models
- How do we implement responsability, ethics, fairness, and justice in the development of AI technologies

---
# Discussion Questions AI and Creativity
- What should the role of AI be in the creative process?
- How is AI changing the labor situation for creative workers?
- How do you feel about "AI Art"?
- How are artists and creatives reacting to AI?

# Watch Coded Language by Saul Williams

---
# Feedback and Strategies for Developing Your Paper
---
# Define Key terms
As you introduce your argument define key terms, both technical and conceptual, which will provide the foundation for your analysis

---
# Guide to Editing
- Writing isn't linear
- Editing is a process of critically reflecting on your own writing

---
# Local Vs Global Revision
- Local revision focuses on changes to individual words and sentences
- Global revision considers structure, evidence, clarity, flow, and mechanics


---
# Tips for a Strong Essay
- Don't be afraid to be bold in your argument, stand on it
- Take the technology seriously and do due dilligence in terms of research 
- Try to avoid lazy/avoid critique, really think through the implications of your argument
- Don't be dismissive but responsible and thought 
- Not just "AI bad" but we have reasoned criqitus of the limiations and social effects of the narratives around AI and alternatives 
- Don't just take a consumer centric approach but think about all stakeholders including developers, decision makers, economics, consumers, and other members of society

# Overall Feedback
- remeber to add et al in your citations
- rememebr to reference which frameworks are informing your critical analysis of the blog post. Are you drawing on an ethical and sociotechnical approach? Are you focused on labor? Are you focused on a philosophical critique? Are you focused on AI hype and Snake Oil?
- Another thing I want to see in your analysis is looking at power. What kind of power is Sam Altman arguing AI companies should have. One of the important factors to consider is that even in a democratic society corporate influence on politics ensures that large corporations have an outsized influence on the "democratic" process and policy decisions. How does this impact your analysis?

---
- I want to see that you are thinking about power and power imbalances
- Make sure you look into both who wrote the blog post and the date the blog post was published. Often blog posts and op eds are published for a reason
- The conclusion is a great place to put forward your a;lternative vision for AI doesn‚Äôt have to be very in depth but what are the values, framworks, principles, and ethics that should guide AI development and implementation
- Feel free to use quotes from the blog posts or op eds you are analyzing 
- LLM is not necessarily the same thing as a chatbot 

---
- Be careful when using the forsythe reading. It's important to note that Forsythe was talking about expert systems in the 90s which from a technical perspective were different then LLMs and current model architecture. So when we reference her article we have to consider how some aspects of her critique are still relevant and important while being careful to note that they were written in a different technical and historical context 
- break up long paragraphs
- Break up long sentences

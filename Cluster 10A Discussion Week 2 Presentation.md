PhD Student, Information Studies



---
### Overview
- Check in
- Review of last weeks concepts
- Data and Information
- History of Statistics
- **Activity** Reading Together
- Discuss keyword assignment

---

# Keywords as a Genre
- Not a <mark>definition</mark>
- Critically think about origin, meaning, uses
- Reveal the complexity of a word or term
- Instability and fluidity of language 

<!--A keyword is not a definition, when we think about keywords we are attempting to think critically about the origin, meaning, and uses of a work. In this class we are -->

# Data
“...the term “data” indicates any form of information—itself a loaded term—that is intended to be put to use.” (Klein and Posner, 2020, p. 83)

---
# What Makes Something Data?
- computationally tractable
- Information put to use
- Purports to represent something
- Can be but not limited to numbers
- Used in argument
<!--Add statements from klein and posner on what is data-->



---
# **Discussion** What Isn't Data?


---
It seems like what we consider to be data has a lot to do with our perspective

What informs our perspective on whether or not we can consider something data?

---
# Computational Tractability
Data is not always necessarily digital, but as Klein and Posner argue, data is something that is computationally tractable, meaning that it can be manipulated, classified, ordered, etc. using computational/mathematical techniques


--- 
# How Do We Define Information

There are many different definitions of information:
- Information as evidence
- Information as signal
- Information as message
- Information as thing 
- Information as semantic content

(Furner, 2010)

---
# Data and Information
Both data and information are terms we use everyday to describe content. The specific meaning and criteria of information and data can depend on context, purpose, and in many cases discipline. 

Part of the power of data and information is the fluidity of the concepts

---
Data tends to emphasize the "for purpose" nature of content while information emphasizes the transmissability

---
# Data as Evidence
Evidence is a particular kind of information that is used to support an argument or chain of reasoning.

---
# King's Theory of Justice

Letter from the Birmingham Jail is an example of how  thinking, method, action, and data plays a role in justice movements

An example of King as a moral philosopher 


---
## What Does Data Have to Do with Justice?

In King's letter, Data is used as evidence to support his argument about justice, and ground his actions in theological truth, moral certitude, and justified action

---

# Society In Raymond Williams

Society $\not =$ State
**Discussion** What's the difference?

---

# How Data Happened

As a concept data emerges from the development of the modern concept of **science**, methods and innovations in **mathematics**, and **theological** arguments. From it's history in these particular disciplines, data inherits a claim to objectivity and truth


---
# Where Did Statistics Come From?


 'Statistik' was coined by Gottfried Achenwall in 1749 and he thought of what he called *statistics* as the collection of 'remarkable facts about the state'.

Statistics evolved out of the study and quantification of the state. Large scale efforts to take census, measure populations, and track state relevant metrics.


<!--printing press, publishing of statistics, sometimes was a private enterprise sometimes was state sponsored, statistics is one way of reading numbers-->
(Hacking, 1990)

### What is an Average

Mathematically we can represent an average as: 
$$
\overline x =  \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}x_{i}
$$

but an average can also be a knowledge claim based on data

With the quote we read in class, Quetelet lays down the philosophical grounding for what an average is and what claims we can make about that data. Statistically we can define a common or average as a typical specimen

---
# A Priori Vs a Posteriori

**a priori**
Knowledge prior to experience

**a posteriori**
knowledge comes after experience, i.e. empirical evidence or data


---

### Modes of Reasoning and Knowledge Production
 
**Deductive reasoning**
deductive reasoning means moving from premises to conclusions by drawing valid inferences. A valid inference means that it logically follows from the premises

**Inductive reasoning**
Inductive reasoning is where generalizations or principles are made from a body of observations

**Abductive reasoning**
Formalized by C.S. Pierce in the 19 th century, abductive reasoning seeks a plausible conclusion from a set of observations

---
# What Do We Do with Data and Statistics?

Statistics when combined with Data can be used for it's **descriptive** or **predictive** purposes

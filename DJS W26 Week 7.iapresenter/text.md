# 5 Theses surrounding data collection
	1. Data sets are the results of their means of collection.
	2. As we collect more data, we prioritize things that fit patterns of collection.
	3. Data sets outlive the rationale for their collection.
	4. Corollary: Especially combined, data sets reveal far more than intended.
	5. Data collection is a transaction that is the result of an invisible relationship.

	"Or as Rob Kitchin and Martin Dodge say in Code/Space,“The effect of abstracting the world is that the world starts to structure itself in the image of the capta and the code.” Data emerges from a world that is increasingly software-mediated, and software thrives on abstraction. It flattens out individual variations in favor of types and models."


---

	As we abstract the world, we prioritize abstractions of the world. The more we look to data to answer our big questions (in areas like policing, safety, and security), the more incentives we have to shape the world into an input that fits into an algorithm. Our need to generate things that feed a model rings true even in cases where the messy bounds of experiences can’t be neatly categorized into bits and bytes, or easily retrieved from tables through queries."

	> The point of data collection is a unique site for unpacking change, abuse, unfairness, bias, and potential. We can’t talk about responsible data without talking about the moment when data becomes data.

# Various kinds of missing data
	- Data that has not been collected
	- Data that has been collected and not processed
	- Knowledge and experience that cannot be reduced to data
	- Data that is lost
	- Data that is erased or hidden

# Absence and Data Saturation
	>"missing data sets is my term for the blank spots that exist in spaces that are data saturated."

# My Example
	*I am studying* machine learning fairness
	*because I want to find out* how ML fairness researchers are defining fairness and developing measurements and assessments of fairness
	*in order to help my reader understand* what values, norms, abstractions, and assumptions are embedded in machine learning fairness interventions and how these might limit effectiveness

# From Research Question to thesis statement

# Locating Missing Data

---
### Activity
# Revising your research question
	Respond to the discussion post by filling in the blanks on the three step formula
	Take your previous research question and revise to relfect  how your work has changes after our two previous assignmentd



---
### Upcoming Assignment
# Final Paper: Missing Data 
	Length: 1700-2000 words
	First draft due: Sunday, March 1, at 11:59 pm.
	Final draft due: Friday, March 20, at 11:59 pm.



---

	What you should do now?
	- Continue collecting sources in your zotero
	- Refine your research topic and research question
	- Start writing and refining your thesis statement
	- Start working on your outline


---
# Locating The Missing Data in Your Assignment
	What specific data already exists about your issue
	What data should but does not exist (Missing data)

---
# Our Key Questions
	- What is missing data?
	- What is a missing dataset?
	- Why is data missing? What does that reveal about society?

	In her later work Mimi Onuoha expands her project to include unknowable things?
# What kinds of things are unknowlable because existing paradigms or power structures prevent us from knowing them?

# Why focus on labor when discussing technology?
- Often, when we talk about technology, we focus on the consumer side; however, this can cause us to miss the more opaque and mundane ways in which technology operates
- Workers lives are increasingly controlled by algorithms that are used by corporations to maximize efficiency
- Focusing on labor when discussing technology reveals the often hidden ways that technology and those in power control society and use technology for domination. We also can find ways of resisting or using technology for justice and liberation
- Alongside transformations in information and communication technologies (ICTs) and revolutions in industrialization, labor practices have changed. Our goal is to study these changes.

> Obfuscation and secrecy work together to form an operating ==logic of opacity== around social media moderation. It is a logic that has left users typically giving little thought to the mechanisms that may or may not be in place to govern what appears, and what is removed, on a social media site. The lack of clarity around policies, procedures and the values that inform them can lead users to have wildly different interpretations of the user experience on the same site. Users may believe, on the one hand, that their site of choice is a place of self-expression and the free exchange of ideas (as encapsulated in posts, images, videos, memes) of all kinds; others may find that the same site’s regulation is draconian, difficult to understand and overzealous. Moreover, the lack of official information from social media firms pertaining to the decisions and operations surrounding what material is deemed acceptable and not further renders the machinery of content moderation opaque. (Roberts, 2018)

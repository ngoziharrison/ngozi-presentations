# Data Portraits Workshop


---
# Data portraits assignment
1. Identify a theme/topic for which you will collect data through observation. 
2. Consider how you will record the data: Are you counting something? Are you recording sounds? Are you talking to people? 
3. How will you delimit, structure, and analyze your data? Are you plotting trends over time or particular events in space? Where does your data collection begin and end?  What are its temporal and spatial bounds?
4. How can you visualize your data and what do you think it “says”? Can you use your data to advance an argument or make a claim about something? 
5. What rhetorical and aesthetic choices will you make to visualize your data? (how will you draw from Du Bois?)

---
# What we will work on today
- Develop and articulate a strong topic and research question for your project
- Describe your methods
- Decide on a mode of visualization for your data and start your visualization
- Conduct and describe your analysis


---
# Which part of the assignment do you feel the least confident about
- research question
- Data collection
- analysis
- visualization

# Research Questions
- Clear and focused
- Specific
- Answerable scope

---
# **Discussion** Let's generate some research questions



--- 
# **Activity** Develop your research question (15 min)
Pair up and take some time to write up your research question
Share your research question and provide feedback
- Why are you interested in this? Why does this matter?
- Is the research question clear?
- What are the limitations?

We'll will go around the room and share back

---
# Methods  and Methodology
- What kind of data (Qualitative or quantitative)
- How did you collect the data
- What are the limits of your data
- What method will you use to analyze and why?
- Ethics?

# DuBois, Data Portraits, and Ways of Seeing
- Data analysis and visulization is fundamentally an interpretive act
- DuBois and his team show the power of visualization by combining the abstraction and visual elemnts with 
- Visualization brings together the storytelling, aesthetics, and the politics of representation to create an opportunity to 
- Through abstraction, visualization flattens and simplifies to highlight an aspect of reality to convey some information about sociological phenomenon

>the rendering of information in a visual format to help communicate data while also generating new patterns and knowledge through the act of visualization itself. 
– Whitney Battle-Baptiste and Britt Rusert

---
# Analysis and Visualization
- Descriptive vs ==Analytical==
- Discuss how the visual and aesthetic choices impact the presentation
- Keep in mind the limitations and your assumptions

# Ways to Visualize data
- Python (Colab/jupyter notebook)
- Excel, Google Sheets
- Tableau
- R
- Hand drawn

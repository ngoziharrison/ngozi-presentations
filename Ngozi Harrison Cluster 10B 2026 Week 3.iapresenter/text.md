### An example of missing data and the limits of quantification
	> “Statistics tell only half of the story, and, in doing so, they become part of the problem. How to correlate the number of lashes a person's ancestor received 190 years ago with their likelihood of being unemployed in July 2020? Or being in the criminal justice system? Or dying of COVID-19?” (da Silva, Unpayable Debt 2022, 166)

# Subject and Object
	A subject possesses unique conscious experiences and can percieve and move through the world. An object is a thing that can be acted upon, percieved, and/or controlled by the subject.

##### From Prof. Bhaumik's Week 2 slides (slide 6)
	> Consider the difference between objectivity and subjectivity in data studies. We frequently presume that data is objective but it is also subjective. Subjectivity is also the different experience of facing algorithms and data-driven sites. For instance, you may love a product on Amazon and another person may have very different feelings toward this product. In addition, there is a difference in data collection and analysis between making an object of the humans/lives/communities you are collecting data about and conducting a subject/subject relation in data collection.

# What is an archive? What are Archives?

	Archival studies is a subfield of information studies that is concerned with records as persistent representations of human activity that travel across space and time. 
	**Critical Archival Studies seeks to:**
	(1) explain what is unjust wth the current state of archival research and practice, 
	(2) posit practical goals for how such research and practice can and should change and/or 
	(3) provide the norms for such critique. 
	(Caswell et al 2017)

# How are archives used?
	- Archives are used by historians, scholars, artists, and many more people seeking information
	- Siddique argues that imperial archives were mobilized various actors in the administration of empire. They were invoked post facto as a justification for decisions and to inform future behavior

### Imperialism and the Imperial Archive
	> The expansion of European polities overseas from the late fifteenth century onward saw governments massively scale up their use of paper—and confront the challenge of controlling its dissemination across thousands of miles of ocean and land. These pressures were felt particularly acutely in what eventually became the largest empire in world history, the British empire. 
	(Siddique, 2024)

# The Challenges of Information/Data Collection
	>...This meant collecting information about their behavior through the technology of paper. Just as we struggle to organize, search, and control our email boxes, text messages, and app notifications, so too did these early moderns confront the attendant challenges of developing practices of collection and storage to manage the resulting information overload.
	(Siddique, 2024)

# Why pay atendion to the history of Data and Imperialism
	> The history of the early modern information state offers no simple or straightforward answers to the questions that data raises for us today. But it does remind us of a crucial truth, all too readily obscured by the deluge of popular narratives glorifying technological innovation: ==that questions of data are inherently questions about politics==—about who gets to collect, control, and use information, and the ends to which information should be put. ==We should resist any effort to insulate data governance from democratic processes—and having an informed perspective on the politics of data requires that we attend not just to its present, but also to its past.==
	(Siddique 2024)

	> “When I look for man in European lifestyles and technology I see a constant denial of man, an avalanche of murders. Man's condition, his projects and collaboration with others on tasks that strengthen man's totality, are new issues which require genuine inspiration. Let us decide not to imitate Europe and let us tense our muscles and our brains in a new direction. Let us endeavor to invent a man in full, something which Europe has been inca­pable of achieving.” (Fanon et al., 2004, p. 236)


---

	> “The Third World must start over ==a new history of man== which takes account of not only the ==occasional prodigious theses main tained by Europe== but also its crimes, the most heinous of which have been committed at the very heart of man, the pathological dismembering of his functions and the erosion of his unity, and in the context of the community, the fracture, the stratification and the bloody tensions fed by class, and finally, on the immense scale of humanity, ==the racial hatred, slavery, exploitation and, above all, the bloodless genocide whereby one and a half billion men have been written off==” ([Fanon et al., 2004, p. 238)

	- Who gets to decide what information should be collected, how it is collected, and used?
	- How has mapping function as a tool of empire and imperialism?
	- What should we do with imperial archives?
	- Can we decolonize data, mapping, information system, archiving? If so how?

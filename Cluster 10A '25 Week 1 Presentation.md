# What is this class about?
Not a data science class but a data studies class
We are interested in the history, social aspects, and ethics of data and how what we do with data affects how we think about each other and society

---
# Guiding Questions for the Course
- What is data?
- Where did the idea of data come from?
- How does data get collected, analyzed, and turned into claims about the real world?
- How data intersects with philosophical inquiries about justice, (in)equality, power, and ethics?
- What can we learn from data? What can't we learn from data?
- Can we use data to create positive social change? If so, how?

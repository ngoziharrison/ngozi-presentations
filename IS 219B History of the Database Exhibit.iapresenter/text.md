# Why is this interesting?
	- Interesting snapshot of the kind of work done by a student in our department in the late 60s/early 70s
	- Can be considered Social Informatics, analyzes the role of a DBMS in a junior college context
	- Describes the use of Data Language-1 (also DL/1 or Data Language/I) and programming languages COBOL and ALC for definition of database structure and retrieval

seems like data language I is not a programming language but what we would call today an API  it's an endpoint or interface for other languages

### Question for the Class

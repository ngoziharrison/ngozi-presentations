# Some things to key in mind regarding Gen AI
	- Keep in mind the tendancy for hallucination, banality, and sycophancy with Gen AI.
	- You can use AI for research and informating seeking but it isn't necessarily the best tool. Make sure you verify the information that you get using Gen AI
	- We want to hear your creative thoughts, reflections and arguments. The goal of this class is that you challenge/refine your thinking and grow in your writing ability
	- If you have used Gen AI you must disclose and describe how you used it in your assignment. If you used Gen AI our past two assignments you can add a comment to your submission disclosing the use and how it was used.
	- Be careful using AI in data analysis, make sure you understand what AI is doing or the code that is being generated

# General Feedback on Data Portraits
	Highlights
	- Very creative visualizations and research questions
	- Thoughtful analysis of your data collection methods
	- I can tell you are gaining fluency with the main course topics and concepts

---
# Constructive Feedback
	When using quotations and citations it's important to provide a close reading and/or tie back to the main argument
	- watch out for ambiguity that can confuse the reader, be specific as much as possible
	- Use sentence transitions and signposts to guide the reader
	- What do you want your reader's key takeaway to be

	Learn yourself as a writer
	- What writers do you like, try to mimic their style, study the craft
	- Identify frequent mistakes you make and when editing read for this
	- Start thinking about your voice
	- My frequent mistakes
		- Overuse of *however*, makes the writing feel repetitive
		- getting lost in tangents and forgetting the main point
		- Long complicated sentences with too many clauses

# Using Textual Evidence to Make arguments
/assets/Clipboard 8.png
size: contain


	> How do you know if you’re making a claim? When you make a claim, you’re saying not just what you see in the text, but how to understand what you see: not just “look at this” but “look at it this way.” The most important parts of local claiming are offering that understanding to your reader and being precise and clear in your language. Getting the claim into just the right words takes time and effort; we often revise our claims until the end of the writing process. While you shouldn’t write a claim with the goal of being contentious, if you’re specific in what you notice and precise in what you say about it, that alone will ensure that no one else is likely to see or say it in quite the same way—your argument will be your own.

# The Getting to Know a Dataset assignment will include two kinds of evidence to support a thesis about your chosen dataset

	1) Textual Evidence from class readings
	2) Evidence from the dataset itself

# Questions to consider when analyzing data sets
	- Describe the dataset?
	- Where did this data come from? 
	- Who collected the data and why? What was the method?
	- What does this data purport to represent?
	- What conclusions can be drawn from the data? What are the limitations? 
	- What are the unaddressed assumptions or gaps?


---
# You can use data analysis to support your dataset analysis
	- Use tools such as rowboat, excel/google sheets, etc to examine your data and create visualizations


---
# Activity Identifying Evidence
	- Break up into groups of 4
	- Select one of the following readings
		- The Imperial Origins of Big Data
		- Biopower and the Avalanche of Printed Numbers
		- Lauren Klein and Miriam Posner "Data"
	- Identify an argument made in the reading and the evidence the writer uses to support this claim
	Find the citation for the evidence presented in the reading

	**Post a response containing the following**
	Reading
	Argument made in the reading
	Evidence used to support this claim

		- What dataset have you selected?
		- What have you learned about the dataset so far?
		- Have you developed a thesis? If so what is your thesis
		- What evidence from the dataset and course readings will you use to support your analysis

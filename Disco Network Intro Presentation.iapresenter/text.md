	from Oakland, CA
	**Previously** Creative Effectiveness Lead @ Google

	**Areas of Interest** Critical AI Studies, Critical Data Studies, ML Fairness and Ethics, Mathematics, Critical Information Studies, Black Computational Thought
	**Research Interests**
	My research is focused on the social aspects of mathematical knowledge, particularly the mathematical and computational methods behind AI, algorithms, and information systems

My research focuses on examining the mathematical, conceptual, and logical foundations of information systems 	and developing decolonized and justice-oriented approaches to data, AI/ML, and information systems

my goal is to develop liberatory approaches for data and algorithms and a framework for Black computational thought
